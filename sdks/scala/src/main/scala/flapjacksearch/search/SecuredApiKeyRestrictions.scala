/** Search API ## Client libraries Use Flapjack's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Flapjack's APIs with
  * your apps. The official API clients are covered by Flapjack's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.flapjack.io/policies/sla). For more information, see [Flapjack's
  * ecosystem](https://www.flapjack.io/doc/guides/getting-started/how-flapjack-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * Base URLs for the Search API: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.flapjack.io` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.flapjack.io`.
  * If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.flapjack.io/infra), this ensures that
  * requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with
  * load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ## Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry
  * strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks: -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.flapjack.io` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.flapjack.io` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.flapjack.io` These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs. Randomize
  * this list to ensure an even load across the three servers. All Flapjack API clients implement this retry strategy. ##
  * Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Flapjack application
  * ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required access
  * control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and
  * API key in the [Flapjack dashboard](https://dashboard.flapjack.io/account/api-keys). ## Request format Depending on
  * the endpoint, request bodies are either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects. ## Parameters Parameters are passed
  * as query parameters for GET and DELETE requests, and in the request body for POST and PUT requests. Query parameters
  * must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must
  * be UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. Arrays as query parameters must be one of: - A
  * comma-separated string: `attributesToRetrieve=title,description` - A URL-encoded JSON array:
  * `attributesToRetrieve=%5B%22title%22,%22description%22%D` ## Response status and errors The Search API returns JSON
  * responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API
  * response. Successful responses return `2xx` statuses. Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return
  * `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of
  * the Search API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

package flapjacksearch.search

/** SecuredApiKeyRestrictions
  *
  * @param filters
  *   Filters that apply to every search made with the secured API key. Extra filters added at search time will be
  *   combined with `AND`. For example, if you set `group:admin` as fixed filter on your generated API key, and add
  *   `groups:visitors` to the search query, the complete set of filters will be `group:admin AND groups:visitors`.
  * @param validUntil
  *   Timestamp when the secured API key expires, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
  * @param restrictIndices
  *   Index names or patterns that this API key can access. By default, an API key can access all indices in the same
  *   application. You can use leading and trailing wildcard characters (`*`): - `dev_*` matches all indices starting
  *   with \"dev_\" - `*_dev` matches all indices ending with \"_dev\" - `*_products_*` matches all indices containing
  *   \"_products_\".
  * @param restrictSources
  *   IP network that are allowed to use this key. You can only add a single source, but you can provide a range of IP
  *   addresses. Use this to protect against API key leaking and reuse.
  * @param userToken
  *   Pseudonymous user identifier to restrict usage of this API key to specific users. By default, rate limits are set
  *   based on IP addresses. This can be an issue if many users search from the same IP address. To avoid this, add a
  *   user token to each generated API key.
